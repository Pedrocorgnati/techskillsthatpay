Cloud hype is noisy; employers still pay for fundamentals plus proof you can keep costs under control. This roadmap focuses on high-signal skills.

## Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1–3)

- Identity (IAM), VPC basics, security groups, and logging.
- Deploy a simple containerized app with IaC (Terraform or Pulumi).
- Create a budget alert; show you respect cost controls.

## Phase 2: Production realism (Weeks 4–8)

- Add observability: metrics, logs, traces. Instrument a demo service.
- Implement least-privilege roles and rotation for secrets.
- Build a CI/CD pipeline that runs tests and deploys safely.

## Phase 3: Cost-aware scaling (Weeks 9–12)

- Right-size compute; experiment with serverless vs. containers.
- Add autoscaling policies and game-day drills to test them.
- Measure and present cost-per-request with a short Loom.

## Resources that match the roadmap

- [AWS Mini-Labs](https://example.com/aff/aws-labs) for focused hands-on practice.
- [Terraform FastTrack](https://example.com/aff/terraform) for infrastructure as code patterns.
- [Cloud Observability Recipes](https://example.com/aff/observability) to instrument services quickly.

## How to present your work

- Keep a changelog in your repo; hiring managers skim this first.
- Record 2–3 minute walkthroughs explaining trade-offs and cost decisions.
- Publish a short post-mortem for a controlled incident you induced.
