Learning paths that lead to income fastest share three traits: they map to clear job titles, produce tangible outputs, and are testable through projects.

## Skills that bypass degree requirements

1. **Technical writing** – turn complex features into concise docs and tutorials. Pair with Loom walkthroughs.
2. **No-code automation** – Zapier/Make, Airtable, and light JavaScript for glue code.
3. **Support engineering** – triage, recreate, and fix issues inside a product. Strong path to solutions engineering.
4. **Data enablement** – SQL, spreadsheets, and lightweight dashboards that unblock teams.
5. **Cloud fundamentals** – basic IAM, VPCs, and container deployment with minimal ops overhead.

## Build a proof-of-work portfolio

- Ship 3–5 public artifacts: a walkthrough video, a GitHub repo, and a short Loom for each project.
- Include a README that states the business impact in one sentence.
- Add a short architecture diagram. Employers want to see structured thinking.

## How to learn fast

- Take a project-first course, then immediately replicate it with a new dataset or use case.
- Set a weekly deliverable with a friend or accountability partner.
- Journal time spent vs. output to cut wasted effort.
