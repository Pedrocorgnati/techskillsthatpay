Security hiring managers look for repeatable habits: structured triage, strong note-taking, and the ability to communicate risk clearly.

## Phase 1: Fundamentals (Weeks 1–4)

- Networking basics (OSI layers, TCP/IP), Linux fundamentals, and scripting.
- Security mindset: threat modeling simple apps.
- Join a blue-team community or practice group.

## Phase 2: Hands-on labs (Weeks 5–8)

- SIEM practice: ingest logs, create detection rules, and triage alerts.
- Incident response drills: root cause, containment, eradication, and recovery.
- Reporting: write concise incident summaries with timelines.

## Phase 3: Portfolio (Weeks 9–12)

- Document three incidents you investigated in a home lab.
- Publish detections you wrote, with before/after false-positive rates.
- Record short walkthroughs showing log pivots and playbooks.

## Resources worth paying for

- [Blue Team Labs](https://example.com/aff/blue-team) — practical SIEM and detection engineering labs.
- [Practical Incident Response](https://example.com/aff/ir-course) — guided scenarios with reports.
- [Security+ Rapid Review](https://example.com/aff/secplus) — if you need a credential to unlock interviews.

## Interview prep

- Practice storytelling: describe the environment, what broke, how you fixed it, and what you would automate next.
- Bring printed playbooks and log snippets to interviews; few candidates do this.
