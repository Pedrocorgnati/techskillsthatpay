Both roles pay well, but the right choice depends on your appetite for software engineering versus business context.

## Pay and trajectory

- **Data engineers** generally start higher because they work closer to production systems.
- **Analysts** can catch up with strong domain expertise and business impact.
- Upside grows when you own end-to-end pipelines and trust with stakeholders.

## Day-to-day differences

- Analysts: metrics design, dashboards, ad-hoc analysis, stakeholder communication.
- Engineers: data modeling, pipelines, orchestration, observability, and reliability.

## How to pick

- Choose **analytics** if you enjoy storytelling with data, rapid feedback loops, and influencing decisions.
- Choose **engineering** if you like systems thinking, performance tuning, and writing maintainable code.

## Starter stacks

- Analyst: SQL, spreadsheets, dbt Core, and a BI tool. Optional: Python for deeper analysis.
- Engineer: Python, SQL, warehouse + lake, orchestration (Airflow/Prefect), IaC, containers.

## Learning paths

- [Analytics Accelerator](https://example.com/aff/analytics) for metrics, dashboards, and stakeholder workflows.
- [Modern Data Engineer](https://example.com/aff/data-engineer) for pipelines, orchestration, and testing.
- [dbt Fundamentals](https://example.com/aff/dbt) to ship production-quality models quickly.

## Bottom line

Pick the role that fits your daily energy. You can switch later—skills overlap more than you think.
