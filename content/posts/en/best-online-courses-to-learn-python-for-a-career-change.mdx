Most Python courses teach syntax. Few teach how to ship business value. This shortlist avoids tutorial hell and keeps you focused on employable projects.

## Selection criteria

- Builds projects with clear business outcomes (automation, APIs, data workflows).
- Uses modern tooling: virtualenv/uv, pytest, type hints, and GitHub Actions.
- Includes feedback or community support to keep you accountable.

## The short list

1. **Automation-first** – [Python Career Jump](https://example.com/aff/python-jump) for scripting repetitive tasks and documenting results.
2. **Data focus** – [Practical Data Toolkit](https://example.com/aff/data-toolkit) to learn pandas, SQL joins, and lightweight dashboards.
3. **Backend basics** – [FastAPI in Practice](https://example.com/aff/fastapi) to build production-style APIs with auth and testing.

## Projects to include in your portfolio

- A browser automation script that saves at least an hour a week.
- A data quality monitor that emails a weekly anomaly report.
- A FastAPI microservice with auth, tests, and a deployment manifest.

## How to study

- Spend 50%+ of time coding your own take on each project.
- Publish short Loom demos; treat them like product walkthroughs.
- Add a README that highlights metrics: time saved, errors prevented, or dollars earned.

Stay disciplined and you can be deploy-ready in 8–12 weeks.
